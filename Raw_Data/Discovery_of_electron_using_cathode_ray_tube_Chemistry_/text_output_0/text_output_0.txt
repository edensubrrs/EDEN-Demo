A cathode-ray tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube containing one or more electron guns, which emit electron beams that are manipulated to display images on a phosphorescent screen.
The images may represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures (television set, computer monitor), radar targets, or other phenomena.
For this presentation, the exterior of the cathode ray tube is made of a plastic which has a shiny surface.
along with two metallic pins, the pins connect to a power supply unit.
A high-tension battery and a low-tension battery run between the two terminals of a battery.
An electric bulb with one hole in the tube is placed between the two holes of the cathode.
The plantative center of the tube divides into two thinner tube called lateral lobes, which are attached to the two pins.
Such lobes are called isotopes.
The tube has two electrical contacts.
The positive terminal of the battery is connected to the emitter electrode.
One kind of thermometer is connected to the
