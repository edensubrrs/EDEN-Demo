A cathode-ray tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube containing one or more electron guns, which emit electron beams that are manipulated to display images on a phosphorescent screen.
The images may represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures (television set, computer monitor), radar targets, or other phenomena.
For constructing a cathode-ray tube, the components required are a high-tension battery, a hydrogen electrode, a thin carbon dioxide glass tube, a phosphor, an electric bulb and a steel nail.
Take two test tubes.
Fill each test tube with half of water.
Dip the metal nail into the water filled in the orange colored water, that is about 1.5 cm in diameter.
Insert a test tube into the filled test tube.
Note the reading of the emitter and the reading of the angle at which the beam of electrons crossing the water glass tube is formed.

Using the principle of electromagnetic induction, extend the cathode rays through the hole in the cardboard.
