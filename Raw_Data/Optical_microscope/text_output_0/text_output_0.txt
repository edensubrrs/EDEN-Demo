The optical microscope, also referred to as a light microscope, is a type of microscope that commonly uses visible light and a system of lenses to generate magnified images of small objects.
Optical microscopes are the oldest design of microscope and were possibly invented in their present compound form in the 17th century.
Scientists have been using optical microscopes to produce original images of objects which are too small to be clearly seen by the naked eye.
Today, we are using electronic microscope which can produce images of objects that are too small to be clearly seen by the naked eye.
The microscope is most widely used for biomedical examination and is also used for determining blood group compatibility.
The microscope consists of a large number of lenses and is characterized by a glass body.
The body tube is open at the top to allow the lens to slide inside the tissue and the image can be focused by moving the cumbersome manometer.
The magnification can be used to produce a clear image of internal structure or objects located at varying distances.
The image can be focused by moving the fine adjustment knob which is located on the front surface of the microscope.
