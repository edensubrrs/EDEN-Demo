The optical microscope, also referred to as a light microscope, is a type of microscope that commonly uses visible light and a system of lenses to generate magnified images of small objects.
Optical microscopes are the oldest design of microscope and were possibly invented in their present compound form in the 17th century.
The microscope is bounded by two membranes, the outer membrane and the inner membrane.
The outer membrane is smooth, while the inner membrane is folded inwards into a number of folds called chrysthe.
The chrysthe of the microscope is further divided into two zones, peripheral membrane and external zone.
Perimeter is enclosed in a bony protective capsule called stroma and the image is formed on the inner surface of the microscope.
There are two main layers of microscopy, peripheral membrane and external zone.
The peripheral membrane is thick and tough that protects the lens from entry and exit of dust, dust and impurities.
The fine dust particles are diffused across the microscope body when it comes in contact with the material.
After dust settles down on the surface of the microscope, it moves to a cooler spot on the inner surface of
