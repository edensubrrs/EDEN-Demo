The optical microscope, also referred to as a light microscope, is a type of microscope that commonly uses visible light and a system of lenses to generate magnified images of small objects.
Optical microscopes are the oldest design of microscope and were possibly invented in their present compound form in the 17th century.
The microscope is bounded by two membranes, the outer membrane and the inner membrane.
The outer membrane is smooth, while the inner membrane is folded inwards into a number of folds called chrysthe.
The chrysthe of the microscope is further divided into two zones, outer cortex and inner granular zone.
The upper region of the chrysthe is rich in silica gel and the lower region is rich in clay and mineral fibers.
The two regions of the inner cortex are further divided into three concentric zones called lacunet which are composed of cornea, pylylogenomic gel and human eye lens.
The each lacunet zone contains a central hollow cavity called the microscope segmentum.
The lens is enclosed in a bony capsule.
The capsule is surrounded by a thin myelin sheath, which contains a white fatty substance called myelin.
myelin is a white fatty substance
