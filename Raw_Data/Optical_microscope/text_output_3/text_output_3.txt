The optical microscope, also referred to as a light microscope, is a type of microscope that commonly uses visible light and a system of lenses to generate magnified images of small objects.
Optical microscopes are the oldest design of microscope and were possibly invented in their present compound form in the 17th century.
Their invention enabled us to produce numerous types of microscopes which are current of science.
The most important application of optical microscope is to study the shapes of dust particles present in a thin layer of oil.
To understand the shapes of such particles, let us take a look at the principal features of an optical microscope.
The lens is a fixed tube that has a glass core through which light travrons can be allowed to pass.
The core is filled with chemically inactive nitrogen or argon gas which prolongs the life of the particles.
The thin tube iscoiled with two mirroring mirrors that control the focal length of the lens.
The two mirrors are fixed at an angle of 45 degrees with the sides of the tube in such a way that the position of the dust particles isi
